# Prep Work - Week 4
# Blocks

#####
# Blocks
# 1. Learn how to use the Array's .each method (plus a block) to print all of
# the elements of an array to the screen.



#####
# Blocks
# 2. Learn how to use the Hash's .each method (plus a block) to print all
# key/value pairs to the screen.



#####
# Blocks
# 3. Create an array of integers. Iterate through that array (using the .each
# method plus a block) and output the integers that are even (Hint: use the
# % operator).



#####
# Blocks
# 4. Create an array of words. Iterate through the array using .each (and a
# block), then print out each of these words in UPPERCASE.



#####
# Blocks
# 5. Create a hash representing a Driver's License (or some other short list
# of information that fits within fields). Iterate over the hash using a .each
# block and output the results so that the label for each data member (i.e.,
# NAME or ID) is all caps but the information itself is represented as written.



#####
# Blocks
# 6. Learn how to use the .select with an array; create an array of integers,
# then .select over it to create a new array of only odd integers.



#####
# Blocks
# 7. Do the same as in the previous problem, but instead of .select over an
# array of words and return only words that start with A or a. (You'll probably
# need to use the string class's methods to figure out how to check the value
# of a pre-determined character in a string.)



#####
# Blocks
# 8. .select over a hash (that you design) to create a new hash whose elements
# fulfill some condition.
